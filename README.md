# ABSTRACT
The task of helping drivers whose cars break down on the road can be difficult for service providers, especially when there are no other vehicles around. To aid drivers, vehicle owners, and mechanics in this situation, a team of researchers is working on an online platform called AYUS. To verify the issue at hand, the researchers carried out a survey using Google Forms to collect information from drivers and conducted interviews with service providers. The matter was authenticated by a total of 20 participants, including 10 vehicle owners or drivers, and 10 service providers or mechanics. The researchers developed the AYUS platform using React Native, a platform renowned for its seamless and effective user interface on both web and mobile. The platform's API serves as a link between the mobile platform and the user, which is facilitated by an exclusive web application accessible only to the administrator. The [API](https://github.com/jaymar921/AYUS-RestAPI) will be developed using a RESTful approach, and the ASP.NET framework will be used to handle both the requests and responses. The researchers possess expertise in the C# programming language, which they will apply to implement the RESTful approach efficiently. The AYUS platform serves as a mediator between vehicle owners and drivers, and nearby vehicle assistance service providers, which will aid in providing immediate assistance and resolving vehicle  breakdown issues. The researchers plan to authenticate the system to ensure the effectiveness of the problem-solving strategy.
